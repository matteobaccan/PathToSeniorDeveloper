## Description of the book

**"Path to Senior Developer"**is a collection of articles and reflections based on my many years of experience in the world of programming. The book is aimed at senior programmers and professionals who wish to improve their technical and methodological skills, addressing topics such as professional growth, best practices, the challenges of the world of software development and much more.
