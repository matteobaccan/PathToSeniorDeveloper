# Losing a Programmer Means Losing a Treasure

An old saying goes, "A friend is a treasure." The positive meaning of this phrase lies in the fact that true friendship—the kind that lets you sleep peacefully because you know that no matter what happens, you'll always have a friend to rely on, who helps you out of desire, not obligation—is rare.

Similarly, a good programmer is a treasure for a company. With their technical skills, experience, and problem-solving abilities, they can make the difference between a project's success and failure.

However, if we look at the flip side, "Losing a programmer means losing a treasure." Too often, the loss of someone who has accumulated experience and skills within the company over time and now decides to move elsewhere is underestimated.

I've seen too many companies suffer setbacks because someone left, whether it was a programmer, a project manager, or an analyst. This article aims to reflect on what it means to lose a programmer and how companies can prevent it from happening.

## The Professional Life of a Programmer

Programmers, like all professionals, go through several significant phases during their careers. However, it's often possible to identify a recurring pattern that appears frequently in this field.

The first phase is joining a project. This is an initial period, of varying length, where the person is introduced to the work environment. It's a time characterized by intense study alternating with practical work, often under the guidance of a more experienced programmer.

Next comes the start of actual work activities. In this phase, the programmer begins working on the first assigned tasks, getting familiar with the project and the team members. They are not yet fully productive but start understanding the project's dynamics and the workgroup.

The third phase is professional maturity. The programmer begins to work independently, knows who to interact with, understands the company's processes deeply, identifies problems, and develops effective solutions. It's a time of great growth and professional satisfaction.

Finally, there is the settling phase, where the programmer has almost all the project's code in hand. The excitement and curiosity that characterized the initial phases gradually diminish. It shifts from a situation where "everything is possible," filled with euphoria and curiosity, to a phase of greater awareness, sometimes even thinking that "everything has already been done" or "nothing more can be done."

It's precisely at this moment that the programmer starts questioning their professional future, their current job, the project, and the company.

As Aristotle says in "Nicomachean Ethics":

```text
Happiness is not a moment or a state that is achieved once and for all, but a process that lasts a lifetime and requires constant commitment to the exercise of virtue.
```

For this reason, companies should proactively intervene to support their programmers during this phase.

## The Loss of Motivation

This phase represents one of the most critical moments in a work life: the gradual loss of motivation, ambitions, prospects, and goals. Everything seems gray or crystallized in a seemingly unchangeable situation.

Some professionals face this phase constructively, channeling their energies into improving existing code, better structuring the project, optimizing processes, and perfecting documentation. They dedicate themselves to those backlog activities that are often postponed and find space only in moments of apparent stasis.

Others, however, begin to develop a deep sense of discouragement, boredom, and frustration. They start looking beyond, seeking new stimuli, new projects, new company realities. And from discouragement to jumping to a new company, the step is surprisingly short.

This process, when viewed closely, is not entirely negative. In many professions, one reaches a saturation point that pushes for change. The unique advantage for programmers is that, if they have the right skills, they can make this change relatively easily compared to other professions. They can transform their work situation quickly and often without even leaving their workstation.

## The Loss of a Programmer

Contrary to what one might superficially think, a programmer is not simply a replaceable element in a company's value chain. This is especially true in contexts where the work team is not very large, and the skills are highly specific, held by a few key people.

Not everyone works in large, well-structured, and redundant companies. Often, one finds themselves in small companies where the development team is under ten people, and losing a programmer can have devastating consequences.

To further complicate the situation, there are projects themselves that lack adequate documentation, are the result of years of overlapping work, and where processes are not optimally structured. In these situations, holistic knowledge, where present, remains concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people.

In this scenario, losing a programmer becomes a serious problem because you truly lose a treasure and, in some cases, even the effective control of the project they were following.

Even in more structured corporate environments, where teams are well-organized and the code is carefully documented and tested, there is a tendency to look for someone who can replicate exactly the skills and activities of the departing programmer.

This aspiration often proves unrealistic because each programmer has their distinctive style, established habits, and specific skills. It's not easy to find someone who can replace them perfectly.

In these situations, you often hear: "I've been looking for someone for months, but I can't find them." This seemingly banal statement actually contains several significant truths: it highlights how the person to be replaced had specific skills that the current team cannot cover and suggests that the compensation they received was probably undervalued compared to the real value they brought to the organization.

Another frequently underestimated aspect in these circumstances is the expectation that the new programmer can fully or partially cover the predecessor's work from day one. Surprisingly, some still harbor this illusion.

Instead, it's crucial to account for the fact that, for a significant period, the team will not be able to maintain the same performance levels. This issue becomes even more critical if the departing programmer is one of the most experienced or if the team is composed of a limited number of people.

## How to Prevent Losing a Programmer

Awareness of a programmer's value should drive companies to create a work environment that encourages their retention and professional development. The key element in this regard is ensuring an adequate level of autonomy in daily work. A programmer should have the freedom to organize their time and activities, choosing the most effective ways to achieve the set goals. This autonomy does not mean isolation or lack of coordination with the team but rather the ability to best express their creativity and technical skills without excessive procedural constraints.

The company must also ensure that the programmer has all the necessary tools to perform their job optimally. This means not only providing adequate hardware and software but also ensuring access to training resources, documentation, and technical support. Too often, companies underestimate the negative impact that obsolete or inadequate tools can have on a programmer's motivation and productivity. The frustration of having to struggle daily with technical limitations can be a strong incentive to seek opportunities elsewhere.

Plato, in "The Republic, Book IV," said, speaking of potters:

```text
If due to poverty he cannot procure the tools or other utensils essential to his art,
he will produce inferior products and make inferior craftsmen of his children or others to whom he teaches his craft.
```

A crucial aspect, often underestimated, is making the programmer truly feel part of the project they are working on. This goes beyond mere technical involvement: it means involving them in strategic decisions, listening to their opinions on architectural choices, and involving them in planning future activities. A programmer who feels truly part of the project develops a sense of belonging and responsibility that goes beyond the simple professional relationship. This emotional bond with the project and the team can be a powerful retention factor, especially in difficult times or when alternative opportunities arise.

When a programmer feels they have a say in decisions regarding their work, can rely on tools that meet the challenges they face, and are an integral part of a meaningful project, the likelihood of them seeking professional alternatives decreases significantly. It's not just about retaining a qualified professional but creating conditions where they can best express their potential, thus contributing not only to the project's success but also to the growth of the entire team.

## Conclusions

The professional journey of a programmer is a complex one, characterized by various phases of growth, moments of enthusiasm, and periods of reflection. It's important for companies to be aware of these critical moments and actively commit to creating a work environment that encourages the retention and development of their programmers.

The treasure metaphor, with which we opened this reflection, gains even more significance when considering the wealth of knowledge, experience, and value a programmer brings. It's not just about technical skills but a wealth of deep understanding of processes, project dynamics, and team relationships.

When a company loses a programmer, it doesn't just lose a resource but a piece of its history and future.

The challenge for modern organizations is not only to attract talent but to create an environment where they can grow, express themselves, and find continuous stimulation. Only through a concrete commitment to valuing their programmers, providing them with autonomy, adequate tools, and a real sense of belonging, can companies hope to retain this treasure. In a world where technology evolves rapidly and skills are increasingly valuable, investing in the satisfaction and growth of their programmers is no longer just a choice but a strategic necessity for long-term success.
