# Beyond Full Stack: Growth Paths in Software Development

The journey to becoming a senior developer is a complex process that goes far beyond the simple acquisition of technical skills. "Beyond Full Stack: Growth Paths in Software Development" explores four fundamental pillars of this professional transformation, starting with the deconstruction of the Full Stack Developer myth - described as a figure who "is neither a backend expert, nor a frontend expert, nor a DevOps expert; knows concepts of UX, UI, SEO, marketing, knows a bit of everything, but nothing in depth" - to the importance of code reviews and software maintenance.

These chapters guide us through an essential professional metamorphosis: from overcoming the illusion of having to master every aspect of software development to the awareness of the consequences of each code modification ("every modification, even the most trivial, can cause performance, regression, security, and maintainability issues").

It analyzes the responsible adoption of new frameworks, warning against the risk of "wasting time and resources" on technologies that are not sustainable in the long term, up to the crucial importance of code reviews, where "it's not about imposing one's own style, but finding a compromise that can be accepted by everyone."

You'll discover how the evolution from junior to senior programmer manifests in the ability to critically evaluate each technical decision, from the impact of a single condition in the code ("the loss of carefree attitude and a set of regressive fears") to managing technical debt and removing obsolete code ("maintaining unused code is expensive and over time represents unnecessary technical debt").

Through concrete examples and deep reflections, this text will accompany you in the process of professional maturation, highlighting how each technical decision must be evaluated not only for its immediate impact but also for its future consequences on the system and the people who will maintain it.
