# Acknowledgments

I am deeply grateful to my family, whose love and unwavering support have enabled me to complete this project. Without their patience, understanding, and encouragement, reaching this milestone would not have been possible.

A special thanks also goes to my friends who have supported me along the way, offering valuable advice, constructive criticism, and shared moments that enriched my work.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who, directly or indirectly, contributed to the creation of this book. Every word, every page, is the result of collective effort and shared passion.

*"Gratitude is not only the memory of the heart but also the light that illuminates the path ahead."* â€“ Anonymous

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
