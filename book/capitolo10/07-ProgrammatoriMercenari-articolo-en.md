# Programmers as the New Mercenaries: The Evolution of Work in the IT Sector

Once upon a time, building a product with a team of programmers was synonymous with long-term stability. Changes in personnel were rare, limited to events like retirements, personal relocations, burnout, and occasionally, irresistible job offers. But the winds of change have blown fiercely: the spread of the Internet and the recent pandemic have accelerated a process that seemed inevitable: the advent of remote work.

Today, even someone living in a secluded farmhouse in the Alps can collaborate with a company in a distant metropolis as easily as they could work for a local business. The IT work landscape has transformed, and with it, the rules of the game.

## From Centralized to Decentralized: A New Paradigm

We've shifted from a model of strong localization of companies and personnel to a revolutionary concept of distributed work. Today, talking about "full remote" companies is no longer heresy but a well-established reality. Employees work from home or various locations, often in different countries. This transformation has opened the doors to an increasing number of professionals, including those less inclined to change, who now find themselves inundated with a continuous stream of job offers, unthinkable just a few years ago.

In the digital age, even lists of companies offering remote work have become a reality. In Italy, for example, the GitHub project "Awesome Italia Remote" collects Italian companies that offer full remote jobs, complete with required technologies and application pages:

This metamorphosis of work reflects what economist Richard Baldwin has called "the great convergence." In his book "The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalization," Baldwin states: "The impact of information technology is creating a new wave of globalization that allows services to be provided remotely, radically changing the global work landscape."

This new reality is a fertile ground of opportunities and challenges, both for workers and companies. For IT professionals passionate about their work, free from strong corporate ties, and seeking higher salaries or stimulating work environments, this could be considered a golden age. Flexibility and opportunities have grown exponentially, opening previously unimaginable horizons.

## From the '80s to Today: A Journey Through IT Work

I fondly remember my first job at a software company. The team was a close-knit group of people who had worked together for years, all living just a few kilometers apart. In that context, stability seemed a given, and external job offers were rare and often unappealing.

That corporate "paradise," where no effort was needed to retain employees, is now a faded memory.

Today, companies face a titanic challenge: retaining their talent. Employee retention has become a crucial corporate mission. Replacing a team member is not only costly but also requires a significant investment of precious time for training and integration.

In the current landscape, a programmer is no longer just a "code monkey." They are a multifaceted professional who embodies a constellation of skills that go far beyond mere coding: product knowledge, understanding of business dynamics, empathy with the end users of the software they develop.

Modern software requires professionals with increasingly specialized skills, both technological and product-related. And it is especially the latter that require time to be honed and perfected.

As labor economist David Autor from MIT astutely observes: "Companies are increasingly investing in firm-specific human capital, making workers more productive in their current roles."

Specialization is a double-edged sword: on one hand, it represents invaluable corporate value; on the other, it can become a risk for employee mobility. The concentration of skills in a few brilliant minds can make the company vulnerable to the loss of fundamental knowledge in case of resignations or retirements.

To tackle this titanic challenge, many companies are implementing innovative retention strategies worthy of a science fiction novel. These include training expense reimbursement programs, enticing stock option offers, regular salary reviews, internal mobility opportunities, and short-term assignments that resemble space missions. Additionally, they are investing in continuous training, both for technical skills and soft skills, offering greater flexibility in work modes and the chance to experiment with new technologies as if they were explorers in uncharted lands.

A few years ago, all these opportunities were reserved for a select few, high-level professionals, or long-term managers. Today, they have become the norm, a must-have for any company that wants to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized and competitive job market.

In the IT realm, training is the lifeblood of developers. Finding companies that invest in training, both internally and by offering budgets for individual growth, is like discovering an oasis in the desert. It represents an invaluable added value for professional and personal growth, a reason to stay anchored to the company instead of being tempted by sirens that do not guarantee equal growth opportunities.

But beware: the IT job market is not a uniform monolith. There are abysmal geographical disparities: in some areas, training is a mirage, and companies prefer to outsource skills rather than cultivate them in-house. Competition has become a global arena, where local companies find themselves competing not only among themselves but also against tech giants that seem straight out of a sci-fi movie.

## The Disparity Between Large and Small Companies: A Digital Abyss

When talking about disparity, the mind immediately goes to geographical differences, dictated by the territory where people work. But in the IT world, where geography is losing significance, the real disparity is in what companies can offer. And the offerings from large companies are increasingly enticing compared to those from smaller entities.

This disparity creates a wage gap that, within a geographical area, can be mitigated, but on a global level becomes a canyon. This wage abyss is a sword of Damocles for small companies desperately trying to retain the best talents.

We can thus talk about a true "digital migration": people remain physically in their territory, but their minds and skills travel through the network, working for companies located anywhere in the world. This digital brain drain represents a titanic challenge for companies trying to retain the best talents: creating reasons to keep people becomes a Herculean task.

## How to Tackle These Challenges? Strategies for a New World of Work

Properly addressing the challenge of knowledge management is a fundamental step for any company that wants to survive in this digital jungle. It is crucial to avoid concentrating essential skills in a single person, as if they were an irreplaceable oracle. Instead, aim to create autonomous and self-sufficient projects, like ecosystems capable of thriving independently. The loss of an expert technician can be a devastating blow, leading to a significant reduction in corporate capital, not only in terms of technical skills but also in knowledge of processes and corporate culture.

From the professionals' perspective, it is important to consider that changing jobs solely for economic reasons may not always be the wisest choice, especially for young people at the beginning of their professional odyssey. Moving through different positions and situations can provide valuable experience and invaluable maturity, but it is essential to find a balance. Money is important, of course, but it is not the only treasure to seek when evaluating a job opportunity.

During my early years of work, I remember a phrase that struck me like a bolt from the blue:

```text
not less than 2, not more than 5
```

I later heard this mantra in a thousand different contexts, but that time it particularly shook me. The phrase referred to the number of years a professional should spend at a company before changing jobs. Less than two years could be interpreted as a lack of stability, more than five as a lack of ambition. This concept, which may seem like a fossil in a rapidly evolving world, still holds some validity, especially in a sector like IT, where the speed of change is comparable to that of light.

There is also another often underestimated aspect that is important to learn when deciding to embark on a programmer's life: any project tackled, in the first months of development, seems like the Garden of Eden. Problems? Rare. And even when they arise, they can be overcome with relative ease, like jumping over a puddle.

But after the first few months, projects start to grow like young titans, becoming increasingly large and complex. The demands, both from clients and management, turn into mountains to climb.

Over time, providing consistent and functional responses to requests becomes a challenge worthy of Sisyphus. It is at this moment that true programmers emerge, those capable of making a product work stably, taking into account a myriad of aspects that never surface during analysis and early versions.

Reaching that level means becoming true professionals, capable of tackling any challenge and solving any problem. Changing projects every six months can increase horizontal knowledge, but at the expense of vertical knowledge, which often makes the difference between creating a software product and making it work.

## Conclusions: Navigating the New World of IT Work

In conclusion, we have entered an era where teams are as fluid as water, and stability has become a concept of the past, a museum relic. Companies must adapt to this new reality, offering competitive conditions and a stimulating work environment to attract and retain talent. At the same time, professionals must carefully evaluate opportunities, considering not only the economic aspect but also professional and personal growth, like explorers in search of the Holy Grail.

Technology is changing the nature of work faster than many organizations can adapt, like a high-speed train racing while stations desperately try to keep up.

At the same time, programmers must be careful not to be deceived by easy corporate relocations and easy money, as they risk giving the impression of being mere code mercenaries rather than passionate and competent individuals in their work. The true value of a programmer is not measured only in lines of code or salary but in the ability to create, innovate, and leave a lasting mark in the digital world.

In this new technological Wild West, only those who can balance ambition and loyalty, technical skills and soft skills, will emerge as true pioneers of coding. The future belongs to those who can navigate these tumultuous waters with wisdom, adaptability, and an unwavering passion for their craft.
